# ELE 494-09: Deep Networks in Machine Learning
## Course Project: **Crime Prediction in the city of Vancouver**

The following repository contains all code written and material used for the project. The final report can be found [here](!https://github.com/NasirKhalid24/ELE494-Project/blob/master/Final%20Report/report.pdf) and it details all the work done.

The *'Notebooks'* folder contains all the code and results for the different Neural Networks made for prediction.

All data used was obtained for the [City of Vancouver Data Catalogue](https://data.vancouver.ca/datacatalogue/index.htm). The *'Datasets'* folder contains downloaded data as well as datasets that were
prepared by us using custom scripts
